# XLSForm to FSH to FHIR Converter
This tool facilitates the conversion of `.xlsx` files, compliant with XLSForm standards, into FHIR Shorthand (FSH) format, subsequently enabling their transformation into FHIR resources. The tool specifically accommodates XLSForm files derived from DSCN or LPDS frameworks.

## Usage Instructions
Before running the script, ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed (refer to the dependencies section). Set the paths for `input_folder` and `output_folder` in `main.py` to correspond with your local file system. Executing the `main.py` script initiates the conversion process, wherein each XLSForm file in the input directory is processed and converted into FSH format. The results, along with operation logs, are saved in the output directory.

## Operational Workflow
The script operates using designated `input/` and `output/` directories, executing the following steps:

1. **Output Folder Preparation**: Existing folders in the output directory are cleared and recreated.
2. **XLSForm Processing**: Reads `.xlsx` files from the input directory. These are first converted to XForm for validation, with any issues logged in the output directory.
3. **Detailed Processing per XLSForm**:
   - Extracts critical data such as survey and choices, along with short name, ID, version, and title from the settings tab.
   - Identifies whether the PROMS is DSCN or LPDS based, as indicated by the `lpds_healthboard_abbreviation` key in the settings.
   - Generates FSH for questionnaires and terminology from the extracted data.
   - Saves the FSH output in appropriate subfolders within the output directory, classified into DSCN or Healthboard (LDPS) folders.
   - Logs operational details and errors in `log_file.txt` in the output directory, with errors also echoed to the console.

4. **SUSHI Transformation**: Executes SUSHI to convert FSH files in `/input/fsh/` into FHIR resources within `/fsh-generated/`. This step is performed separately for DSCN and each Healthboard LDPS folder, potentially running multiple times. The generated FHIR resources are then ready for transfer to respective repositories.

## Important Notes on DSCN vs LPDS Processing

### Question Reference Codes
DSCN questionnaires include `Questionnaire.item.code` elements that reference a centralized Question Reference CodeSystem (`https://fhir.nhs.wales/CodeSystem/QuestionReferenceCS`). This CodeSystem contains all question identifiers across all DSCN questionnaires.

LPDS questionnaires do not include `Questionnaire.item.code` elements. Each health board manages their own questionnaires independently without a centralized question reference system. At this moment in time.

### DSCN Question Reference CodeSystem Generation
⚠️ IMPORTANT: To generate a complete and accurate Question Reference CodeSystem for DSCN:

1. **All DSCN XLSForm files must be present in the input folder** every time you run the conversion. The CodeSystem is generated by collecting all question codes from all DSCN questionnaires processed in that run.

2. If you only process a subset of DSCN questionnaires, the generated Question Reference CodeSystem will be incomplete and will deviate significantly from the previously published version.

3. When DSCN questionnaires are added or updated:
   - Run the conversion with ALL DSCN XLSForms in the input folder
   - Manually review/diff the newly generated Question Reference CodeSystem against the currently published version
   - Carefully validate what changes need to be incorporated into the published CodeSystem


## Compatibility with XLSForm Types
This tool supports the conversion of the following XLSForm elements:
* Text
* Note
* Select_one
* Select_multiple ⚠️ WARNING: This feature is provided for future support and should be used with caution. Please validate thoroughly before production use.
* Decimal
* Integer
* Begin group

Refer to the mapping table provided for details on how specific DSCN fields correspond to XLSForm elements and their subsequent mapping to FHIR resources.
